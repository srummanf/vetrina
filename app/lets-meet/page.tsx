              <br />
              I'm someone who revels in the minds of Fyodor, Kafka, and Camus â€”
              drawn to existential depths â€” yet hopelessly romantic, often found
              reciting Urdu poetry under my breath. You get the picture: an
              ambivert with layers, my friend.
              <br />
              <br />
              Ideally, we'd meet over a slow coffee in a quiet cafÃ© â€” or maybe
              at a Chinese joint serving proper halal. But let's be honestâ€¦
              nothing beats bonding over a Biryani âŠ¹ Raita âŠ¹ Coke combo. (Yes
              yes â€” Diet Coke with a 1000-calorie plate. Hypocrisy tastes good.)

              <br />
              Am I always free? <span className="italic">Ha! </span> Not quite.
              But if you're my friend, or maybe my{" "}
              <span className="italic">amore</span> â€” I will **definitely** find
              a way.
              <br />
              Text me. Call me. You probably have my number if you know me.
              <br />

                Woo Haah!
              </span>
              <br /> Let's make it a scene.
              <br />
